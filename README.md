Since our csv files were too big, you have to copy and paste the csv files into the backend. They don't need to be in any folder, just the backend. 
Here is the box link to them: https://byu.box.com/s/1y66dwqyl51fnpvxcw0w9ln5wc1ktn67. 
We recommend cloning the repo in Visual Studio or Rider for the backend and then running that (after copying and pasting the csv files into the backend). Then cloning, opening, and running the code in the repo for the frontend on Visual Studio Code. 
There is a delay when you first open the site. After like 5 seconds or a little more, the IDs show up and then after selecting an ID, there is a slight lag before the recommendations pop up.
